where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

                   Version 2.1, February 1999
</code></pre>
<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>(This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">                        Preamble
</code></pre>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.</p>
<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.</p>
<p>We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.</p>
<p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">              GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
</code></pre>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol>
<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>
<p>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="hljs">a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</code></pre>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.</li>
</ol>
<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</code></pre>
<p>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.</p>
<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="hljs">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</code></pre>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">                  NO WARRANTY
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>

with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

meet the following conditions:</p>

stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that
    Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
    modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
    other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Distribution Obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
    made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
    in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.2. Modifications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
    sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.3. Required Notices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
    the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within
    the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
    that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
    make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
    Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.6. Larger Works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
    of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Versions of the License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.1. New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
    from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
    Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
    steward.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.3. Modified Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
    references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
    and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;ldquo;AS IS&amp;rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
        IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
        THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
        ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. TERMINATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
    comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
    survive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
    is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Participant&amp;rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
    Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
    Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
    Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
    unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
    such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
    Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
    settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
    licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
    the amount or value of any payment or license.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
    been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
    You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
        OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
        SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
        LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
        OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
        NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;ldquo;commercial item,&amp;rdquo; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
        1995), consisting of &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software&amp;rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. &amp;sect; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software documentation&amp;rdquo; as such
        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
        227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
        only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
        any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
        License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
        make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
        contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
        costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
        expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
        construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
        for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
        regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
        Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
        arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
        Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
    conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
    the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
    with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&lt;br/&gt;
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
    Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
    to your programs, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
    designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
    software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
    you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
    recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
    you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
    no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
    recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
    not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
    or not licensed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
    copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;,
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the
    Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
    translation is included without limitation in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each licensee is addressed
    as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
    outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
    running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to
    the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
    the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
    work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
    and the date of any change.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
    derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
    started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
    how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
    print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
    derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
    But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
    to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
    you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
    works based on the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
    on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
    the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
    charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy
    of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
    code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
    in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
    executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
    on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
    offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
    actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
    other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
    conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
    at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
    this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
    balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
    to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
    free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
    distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
    by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
    distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
    may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
    License which applies to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following the terms
    and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
    the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO
    THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
    HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
    YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
    OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
    to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
    source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&lt;br/&gt;
    Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without
    even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
    License for more details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not,
    write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive
    mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
    WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
    certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
    License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright
    disclaimer&amp;quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes
    passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
    program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;background-color:yellow;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;CLASSPATH&amp;quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the following clarification and special
        exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source
        file's header the words &amp;quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the &amp;quot;Classpath&amp;quot;
        exception as provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
        this library.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the
        whole combination. &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library
        with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
        modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that
        you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
        module.&amp;nbsp; An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.&amp;nbsp;
        If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
        not obligated to do so.&amp;nbsp; If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
        version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. License Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual
    property claims, the Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial
    Developer, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or
    portions thereof), with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Software, to make,
    have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or
    portions thereof).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer
    first distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a third party under the terms of
    this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You delete
    from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original
    Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or devices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2.2. Contributor Grant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual
    property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to
    use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such
    Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
    Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that
    Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications
    made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that
    Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
    distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that
    Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
    modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
    other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Distribution Obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
    made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
    in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.2. Modifications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
    sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.3. Required Notices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
    the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within
    the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
    that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
    make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
    Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.6. Larger Works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
    of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Versions of the License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.1. New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
    from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
    Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
    steward.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.3. Modified Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
    references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
    and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;ldquo;AS IS&amp;rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
        IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
        THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
        ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. TERMINATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
    comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
    survive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
    is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Participant&amp;rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
    Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
    Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
    Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
    unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
    such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
    Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
    settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
    licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
    the amount or value of any payment or license.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
    been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
    You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
        OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
        SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
        LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
        OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
        NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;ldquo;commercial item,&amp;rdquo; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
        1995), consisting of &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software&amp;rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. &amp;sect; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software documentation&amp;rdquo; as such
        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
        227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
        only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
        any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
        License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
        make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
        contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
        costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
        expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
        construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
        for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
        regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
        Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
        arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
        Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
    conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
    the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
    with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&lt;br/&gt;
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
    Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
    to your programs, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
    designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
    software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
    you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
    recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
    you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
    no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
    recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
    not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
    or not licensed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
    copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;,
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the
    Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
    translation is included without limitation in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each licensee is addressed
    as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
    outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
    running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to
    the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
    the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
    work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
    and the date of any change.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
    derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
    started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
    how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
    print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
    derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
    But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
    to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
    you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
    works based on the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
    on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
    the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
    charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy
    of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
    code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
    in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
    executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
    on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
    offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
    actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
    other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
    conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
    at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
    this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
    balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
    to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
    free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
    distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
    by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
    distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
    may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
    License which applies to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following the terms
    and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
    the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO
    THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
    HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
    YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
    OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
    to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
    source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&lt;br/&gt;
    Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without
    even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
    License for more details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not,
    write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive
    mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
    WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
    certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
    License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright
    disclaimer&amp;quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes
    passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
    program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;background-color:yellow;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;CLASSPATH&amp;quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the following clarification and special
        exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source
        file's header the words &amp;quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the &amp;quot;Classpath&amp;quot;
        exception as provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
        this library.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the
        whole combination. &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library
        with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
        modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that
        you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
        module.&amp;nbsp; An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.&amp;nbsp;
        If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
        not obligated to do so.&amp;nbsp; If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
        version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    portions thereof), with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Software, to make,
    have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or
    portions thereof).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer
    first distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a third party under the terms of
    this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You delete
    from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original
    Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or devices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2.2. Contributor Grant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual
    property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to
    use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such
    Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
    Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that
    Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications
    made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that
    Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
    distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that
    Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
    modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
    other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Distribution Obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
    made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
    in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.2. Modifications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
    License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
    sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.3. Required Notices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
    the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within
    the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
    under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
    that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
    make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
    Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.6. Larger Works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
    of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Versions of the License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.1. New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
    from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
    Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
    steward.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4.3. Modified Versions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
    You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
    references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
    and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;ldquo;AS IS&amp;rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
        IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
        THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
        ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. TERMINATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
    comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
    survive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
    is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Participant&amp;rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
    Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
    Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
    Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
    unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
    such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
    Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
    settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
    licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
    the amount or value of any payment or license.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
    been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
    You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
        OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
        SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
        LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
        OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
        NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;ldquo;commercial item,&amp;rdquo; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
        1995), consisting of &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software&amp;rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. &amp;sect; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;ldquo;commercial computer software documentation&amp;rdquo; as such
        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
        227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
        only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
        any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
        License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
        make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
        contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
        costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
        expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
        construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
        for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
        regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
        Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
        arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
        Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
    conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
    the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
    with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&lt;br/&gt;
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
    Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
    to your programs, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
    designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
    software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
    you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
    recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
    you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
    no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
    recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
    not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
    or not licensed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
    copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;,
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the
    Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
    translation is included without limitation in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each licensee is addressed
    as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
    outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
    running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to
    the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
    the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
    work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
    and the date of any change.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
    derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
    started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
    how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
    print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
    derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
    But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
    to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
    you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
    works based on the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
    on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
    the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
    charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy
    of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
    code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
    in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
    executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
    on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
    offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
    actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
    other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
    conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
    at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
    this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
    balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
    to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
    free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
    distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
    by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
    distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
    may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
    License which applies to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following the terms
    and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
    the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO
    THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
    HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
    YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
    OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
    to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
    source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&lt;br/&gt;
    Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without
    even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
    License for more details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not,
    write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive
    mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
    WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
    certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
    License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright
    disclaimer&amp;quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes
    passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989&lt;br/&gt;
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
    program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
    License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;background-color:yellow;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;CLASSPATH&amp;quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the following clarification and special
        exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source
        file's header the words &amp;quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the &amp;quot;Classpath&amp;quot;
        exception as provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
        this library.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the
        whole combination. &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library
        with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
        modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that
        you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
        module.&amp;nbsp; An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.&amp;nbsp;
        If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
        not obligated to do so.&amp;nbsp; If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
        version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p></li>
<li><p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>

offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software
(or portions thereof).</p>
<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on
the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the
Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this
License.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or
(2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software
with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination).</p>
<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the
Modifications available to a third party.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third
party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination
of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
(except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
Modifications made by that Contributor.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
<p>3.2. Modifications.</p>
<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
Initial Developer.</p>
<p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Software.</p></li>
<li><p>Versions of the License.</p>
<p>4.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
this License.</p>
<p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.</p>
<p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.</p></li>
<li><p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p></li>
<li><p>TERMINATION.</p>
<p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.</p>
<p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
assert such claim is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.</p>
<p>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.</p>
<p>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</p></li>
<li><p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer
software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. AS
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot;
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
software under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p></li>
<li><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE (CDDL)</p>
<p>The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the
state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California.</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
Boston, MA 02110-1335
USA</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers
to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be

<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.</p>

<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
</code></pre>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</code></pre>
<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w' and</code>show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than <code>show w' and</code>show c'; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
that accompanied this code.&quot;</p>
<p>You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
licensed to you under their original licenses.</p>
<p>Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
further distribute the package.</p>
<p>Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
Exception or making modifications to this package which may
subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
software.</p>
<p>CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
combination.</p>
<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.</p>

Modifications made by that Contributor.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
<p>3.2. Modifications.</p>
<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
Initial Developer.</p>
<p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Software.</p></li>
<li><p>Versions of the License.</p>
<p>4.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
this License.</p>
<p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.</p>
<p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.</p></li>
<li><p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p></li>
<li><p>TERMINATION.</p>
<p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.</p>
<p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
assert such claim is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.</p>
<p>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.</p>
<p>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</p></li>
<li><p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer
software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. AS
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot;
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
software under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p></li>
<li><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE (CDDL)</p>
<p>The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the
state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers
to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</li>
</ol>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
</code></pre>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</code></pre>
<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w' and</code>show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than <code>show w' and</code>show c'; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
that accompanied this code.&quot;</p>
<p>You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
licensed to you under their original licenses.</p>
<p>Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
further distribute the package.</p>
<p>Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
Exception or making modifications to this package which may
subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
software.</p>
<p>CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
combination.</p>
<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.</p>

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

<p>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p>

<p>2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.</p>
<p>Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of

with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or

display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination).</p>
<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the

<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third
party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination
of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
(except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
Modifications made by that Contributor.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
<p>3.2. Modifications.</p>
<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
Initial Developer.</p>
<p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Software.</p></li>
<li><p>Versions of the License.</p>
<p>4.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
this License.</p>
<p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.</p>
<p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.</p></li>
<li><p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p></li>
<li><p>TERMINATION.</p>
<p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.</p>
<p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
assert such claim is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.</p>
<p>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.</p>
<p>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</p></li>
<li><p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer
software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. AS
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot;
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
software under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p></li>
<li><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE (CDDL)</p>
<p>The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the
state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California.</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
Boston, MA 02110-1335
USA</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers
to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</li>
</ol>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
</code></pre>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w' and</code>show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than <code>show w' and</code>show c'; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
that accompanied this code.&quot;</p>
<p>You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
licensed to you under their original licenses.</p>
<p>Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
further distribute the package.</p>
<p>Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
Exception or making modifications to this package which may
subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
software.</p>
<p>CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
combination.</p>
<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.</p>

<p>JUnit</p>
<p>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</p>
<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<ol>
<li>DEFINITIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

  i) changes to the Program, and

  ii) additions to the Program;

  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
</code></pre>
<p>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
not derivative works of the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
<p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
<p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</p>
<p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by
any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>
<p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
set forth in this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>REQUIREMENTS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

  b) its license agreement:

  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
</code></pre>
<p>conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
</code></pre>
<p>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
</code></pre>
<p>offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
</code></pre>
<p>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
</code></pre>
<p>Program.</p>
<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.</p>
<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>NO WARRANTY</li>
</ol>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</li>
</ol>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>GENERAL</li>
</ol>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
in any resulting litigation.</p>

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

<li>License Grants and Conditions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>2.1. Grants</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p>
<p>2.2. Effective Date</p>
<p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.</p>
<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:</p>
<p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
or</p>
<p>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
Version); or</p>
<p>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
its Contributions.</p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
<p>2.5. Representation</p>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.</p>
<p>2.7. Conditions</p>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Responsibilities</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.</p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
<p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).</p>
<p>3.4. Notices</p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Termination</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

<p><h2>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h2></p>
<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT.</p>
<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>
<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>
<p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
<p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
<p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
<p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
<p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
are not derivative works of the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
with this Agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>
<p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
source code and object code form.</p>
<p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</p>
<p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
that license before distributing the Program.</p>
<p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
<p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and</p>
<p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>
<p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
<p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>
<p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
party; and</p>
<p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.</p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
<p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
copy of the Program.</p>
<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.</p>
<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.</p>
<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
interruption of operations.</p>
<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>

<p>===========================================================================</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License (GPL)</p>
<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<ol>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program
or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:</p>
<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
not required to print an announcement.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
Subsection b above.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.</li>
</ol>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

</code></pre>
<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, and under any national implementation
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementations thereof.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
&quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this CC0 or use of the Work.</p>

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,

implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

</code></pre>
<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, and under any national implementation
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementations thereof.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
&quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this CC0 or use of the Work.</p>

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>

<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>
